# A-DevopsChallenge

Description
In the "Unit Conversion" science unit, students will be given conversion problems involving temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine. After completing their worksheets, students will submit their answers to the teacher for grading.

Features
1. Input Values

The teacher can provide an input numerical value for the unit conversion problem.
The teacher must specify the input unit of measure (e.g., Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Rankine).
The teacher must provide the target unit of measure (e.g., Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Rankine).
The teacher should also input the student's numeric response for the conversion problem.

2. Grading and Feedback

The system will automatically evaluate the student's response and compare it to an authoritative answer.
If the student's response matches the authoritative answer after both are rounded to the tenths place, it will be considered correct.
If the response does not match the authoritative answer after rounding, it will be marked as incorrect.
If the input data provided by the teacher is invalid or incomplete, the system will indicate the issue and prompt for valid input.
Usage
The Unit Conversion Grading System can be used via different interfaces:

1. Command Line Interface (CLI) - Implementing


Teachers can use the CLI to enter input values and view the grading results directly in their terminal.

2. ReST API


For more advanced users, the ReST API can be utilized to integrate the grading system into other applications or systems.
3. Browser Interface

For a user-friendly and intuitive experience, teachers can access the grading system through a web-based browser interface.
